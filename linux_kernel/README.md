# ACVP-Proto for Linux Kernel

The ACVP-Proto can be compiled for the Linux kernel. As usual, any backend could be compiled along with the ACVP-Proto, provided the kernel contains the support required by the backend.

For now, this applies only to leancrypto which is automatically selected. Yet, if other backends become available, the `Makefile` simply needs to be adjusted to compile the respective other backend.

## POSIX Header Files

The POSIX header files in this Linux kernel build directory are empty and are only used to satisfy the include dependencies of the protobuf header files automatically generated by `protoc-c`. As these files are automatically generated (and can be re-generated as needed), it makes no sense to modify these files directly. Thus the `Makefile` includes the current directory during building to ensure the compiler finds these header files (albeit they are empty).

The code these header files ought to deliver is provided with `frontend_headers.h` which is included before the protobuf header files in the C code.
