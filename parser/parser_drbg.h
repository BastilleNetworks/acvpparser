/**
 * @brief DRBG cipher data structure holding the data for the cipher
 *	  operations specified in drbg_backend.
 *
 * All variables and how they are applied with the DRBG implementation are
 * documented in the CAVS specification for the DRBG.
 *
 * @var entropy [in] Buffer holding the entropy string in binary form.
 * @var nonce [in] Buffer holding the nonce string in binary form.
 * @var pers [in] Buffer holding the personalization string in binary form.
 * @var addtl_reseed [in]
 * 		Data structure holding the additional input string to be used
 *		for the reseed operation before the random number generation
 *		operation. It is allowed to to contain NULL entries when no
 *		additional data is required.
 * @var entropy_reseed [in]
 *		Data structure holding the entropy input string to be used for
 *		the reseed operation before the random number generation. It is
 *		allowed to to contain NULL entries when no entropy data is
 *		required.
 * @var addtl_generate [in]
 *			Data structure holding the additional input string in
 *		 	for the prediction resistance operation in binary form.
 *			This data structure holds two buffers for the first and
 *			second reseed operation. The first buffer corresponds
 *			with the first reseed and the second buffer corresponds
 *			with the second reseed. It is allowed to to contain NULL
 *			entries when no additional data is required.
 * @var entropy_generate [in]
 *			  Data structure holding the entropy input string in
 *			  for the prediction resistance operation in binary
 *			  form. This data structure holds two buffers for the
 *			  first and second reseed operation. The first buffer
 *			  corresponds with the first reseed and the second
 *			  buffer corresponds with the second reseed. It is
 *			  allowed to to contain NULL entries when no
 *			  entropy data is required.
 * @var random [out] The buffer to hold the generated random number in binary
 *		       form (buffer must be allocated by the backend, and the
 *		       parser releases the buffer).
 * @var type [in] DRBG type - DRBGCTR or DRBGHASH or DRBGHMAC
 * @var cipher [in] Cipher specification as defined in cipher_definitions.h.
 *				 * AES128
 *				 * AES192
 *				 * AES256
 *				 * SHA1
 *				 * SHA224
 *				 * SHA256

 *				 * SHA384
 *				 * SHA512
 *				 * SHA512224
 *				 * SHA512256
 * @var rnd_data_bits_len [in] Length of random data to produce in bits.
 * @var pr [in] Prediction resistance enabled (1 == true, 0 == false)
 * @var df [in] Derivation function requested (1 == true, 0 == false)
