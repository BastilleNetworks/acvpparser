/**
 * @brief AEAD cipher data structure holding the data for the cipher
 *	  operations specified in aead_backend
 *
 * @var key [in] Symmetric key for cipher operation in binary form
 * @var iv [in/out] IV for the cipher operation in binary form. It may be
 *		    empty for ciphers that do not support IVs (like AES-ECB or
 *		    AES-KW). For GCM with internal IV generation, the backend
 *		    must allocate the buffer, and fill it appropriately.
 * @var ivlen [in] If @var iv is NULL, but @var ivlen is set, the
 *		   cipher implementation is requested to invoke GCM with
 *		   internal IV generation. The IV of the given length shall
 *		   be generated. The size is given in bits.
 * @var assoc [in] Buffer holding the associated authenticated data.
 * @var tag [in/out] Buffer holding the tag value. This value contains NULL
 *		     for encryption operations. The backend must allocate the
 *		     buffer of the size given in @var taglen. This buffer
 *		     released by the parser. For decryption, this buffer
 *		     contains the tag value to be used for decryption.
 * @var taglen [in] For encryption, this value specifies the size of the
 *		    tag that shall be created. The value is in bits. This
 *		    value is irrelevant for decryption.
 * @var cipher [in] Cipher specification as defined in cipher_definitions.h
 * @var ptlen [in] Length of plaintext (for decryption, this is the expected)
 *		   data length.
 * @var data [in/out] Buffer with input data that is also expected to hold
 *		      the result data. Note, this buffer will
 *		      receive the resulting data from the decryption operation
 *		      without tag or AAD.
 * @var integrity_error [out] This variable is to be filled by the backend
 *			      during a decryption operation to indicate
 *			      whether the decryption was successful (0 value)
 *			      or whether an integrity error occurred (value
 *			      of 1). Note, in this case, the @var data
 *			      buffer should be released.
 * @var priv [storage] This pointer allows the backend to store private data
 *			 like a pointer to a cipher handle allocated during
 *			 the init call and used during update or fini calls.
 *			 The backend must deallocate the resources during fini
 *			 call.
