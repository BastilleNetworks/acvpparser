 * @var cipher [in] Hash algorithm to be used for PRF as well as symmetric
 *		      cipher reference which is to be used to determine the
 *		      key and IV length for the output. For the symmetric

 *	case ACVP_AES128:
 *		enclen = 16;
 *		ivlen = 16;
 *		break;

 *		enclen = 32;
 *		ivlen = 16;
 *		break;
 *	case ACVP_TDESECB:
 *		enclen = 24;
 *		ivlen = 8;
 *		break;
 *	default:
 *		logger(LOGGER_WARN, "Cipher not identified\n");
 *		ret = -EINVAL;
 *		goto out;
 *	}
 *
 *		     The hash can be parsed with the following code:
 *
 * switch (data->cipher & ACVP_HASHMASK) {
 *	case ACVP_SHA1:
 *		maclen = 20;
 *		break;
 *	case ACVP_SHA256:
 *		maclen = 32;
 *		break;
 *	case ACVP_SHA384:
 *		maclen = 48;
 *		break;
 *	case ACVP_SHA512:
 *		maclen = 64;
 *		break;
 *	default:
 *		logger(LOGGER_WARN, "Mac not identified\n");
 *		ret = -EINVAL;
 *		goto out;
 *	}
