# To test the Linux kernel implementation, the protobuf backend has to be used.
# The following test system setup must be achieved:
# 1. compile the leancrypto kernel module and insmod it
# 2. compile the kernel version of ACVP-Proto and insmod it (make sure you have
#    enabled PROTOBUF_BACKEND_EXIM_DEBUGFS in backend_protobuf.c.
# 3. compile ACVP-Parser execute it with this very script - mind you it needs
#    access to DebugFS which today is typically mounted 0700 root:root. Either
#    change the permissions or execute this very script as root.
