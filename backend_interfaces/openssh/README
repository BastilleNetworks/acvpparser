SSHv2 KDF CAVS Test
===================

This code implements the CAVS test for the SSHv2 key derivation function that is
implemented by kex_derive_keys_bn().

Compile
-------

To compile the code, do the following:

1. add ssh-cavs.c it to the OpenSSH code tree

2. add the following to Makefile.in

SSHCAVSOBJS := roaming_dummy.o
ssh-cavs$(EXEEXT): $(LIBCOMPAT) libssh.a $(SSHCAVSOBJS) ssh-cavs.o
        $(LD) -o $@ $(SSHCAVSOBJS) ssh-cavs.o $(LDFLAGS) -lssh -lopenbsd-compat $(LIBS)

3. Add ssh-cavs$(EXEEXT) to the TARGETS line in Makefile.in

4. configure and compile the SSH code

Execute Test
------------

Use the provided ssh-cavs_driver.pl and ensure that the ssh-cavs application
is in the current directory (ssh-cavs does not depend on any special library
and can therefore be copied around).

Now, execute:

	ssh-cavs_driver.pl ssh.req

and return the generated ssh.rsp file back to the FIPS lab for verification.
